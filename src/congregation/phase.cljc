  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the congregation analog of `cloud-
  itonami-isic-6512`'s `casualty.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- matter intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds pastoral assessment +
                                 safeguarding-concern screening
                                 writes, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:matter/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 finalize-pastoral-referral`/
                                 `:actuation/publish-doctrinal-
                                 statement` NEVER auto-commit, at any
                                 phase.

  `:actuation/finalize-pastoral-referral`/`:actuation/publish-
  doctrinal-statement` are deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Finalizing a real pastoral-care
  referral and publishing a real public doctrinal statement are the
  two real-world congregational acts this actor performs; both are
  always a human clergy/religious-leadership call. `congregation.
  governor`'s `:actuation/finalize-pastoral-referral`/`:actuation/
  publish-doctrinal-statement` high-stakes gate enforces the same
  invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on this.
  `:safeguarding/screen` is likewise never auto-eligible, at any phase
  -- the same posture every sibling's screening op has. Phase 3's
  `:auto` set here has only ONE member (`:matter/intake`) -- this
  domain has no separate no-capital-risk 'file' lifecycle distinct
  from the matter record itself.")
